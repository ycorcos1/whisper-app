## Common Issues

### Issue: Presence not updating

**Symptoms:** Green dot stuck even when user offline

**Possible Causes:**

- RTDB rules not configured
- `databaseURL` missing in Firebase config
- Network connectivity issues

**Debug:**

```bash
# Check RTDB connection in console
✅ Presence initialized for user: <uid>
✅ Realtime Database initialized
```

### Issue: Typing indicator flickers

**Symptoms:** Rapid show/hide of typing indicator

**Possible Causes:**

- Debounce not working
- Multiple typing calls triggered

**Debug:**

- Verify TYPING_DEBOUNCE = 250ms
- Check console for duplicate calls

### Issue: Green dot always gray

**Symptoms:** All users appear offline

**Possible Causes:**

- usePresence not initialized
- AppWithPresence wrapper missing
- User not authenticated

**Debug:**

- Verify App.tsx has `<AppWithPresence />` wrapper
- Check auth state is active
- Verify RTDB rules allow reads

// usePresence.test.ts
- Should initialize presence on mount
- Should clear presence on unmount
- Should update heartbeat every 25s
- Should mark offline after 60s idle

// useTypingIndicator.test.ts
- Should debounce typing by 250ms
- Should clear typing after 2s TTL
- Should clear typing on message send
```

```typescript
// presence-integration.test.ts
- Should sync presence across multiple clients
- Should handle disconnect gracefully
- Should restore presence on reconnect
```
