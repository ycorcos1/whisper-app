### Phase 1: Meeting Scheduler Foundation

**Date/Time Parsing & Role System**

#### Core Components Implemented:

1. **Date/Time Parser** (`src/agent/planner/dateParser.ts`)

   - Natural language parsing: "next friday at 3pm", "tomorrow at 9am"
   - Duration parsing and "earliest available" handling
   - Multiple format support

2. **Member Role System**

   - 6 role types: Friend, PM, SE, QA, Design, Stakeholder
   - Self-identification model (users set their own roles)
   - Persistent storage in Firestore
   - Role-based scheduling support

3. **Type Definitions** (`src/types/casper.ts`)

   - `ConversationMember`, `ScheduleEvent` interfaces
   - Role aliases for natural language matching
   - Comprehensive TypeScript coverage

4. **ChatSettingsScreen UI**
   - Role selector badges with modal interface
   - Real-time updates and persistence
   - Visual role indicators

#### Dependencies Added:

- `chrono-node`: Natural language date parsing
- `date-fns`: Date manipulation utilities

### Phase 2: Schedule Command Processing

**Natural Language Command Infrastructure**

#### Core Components:

1. **Schedule Command Parser** (`src/agent/planner/scheduleParser.ts`)

   - Parse natural language meeting requests
   - Extract participants, date/time, duration
   - Support for role-based and name-based matching
   - Command validation and error handling

2. **Schedule Storage Service** (`src/agent/planner/scheduleService.ts`)

   - Firestore storage operations
   - Multi-participant event creation
   - Conflict detection and resolution
   - Meeting retrieval and filtering

3. **Scheduling Integration Service** (`src/agent/planner/schedulingService.ts`)
   - Complete scheduling workflow orchestration
   - Command detection and routing
   - Result formatting and confirmation

#### Supported Commands:

- "Schedule a meeting with everyone for next Friday at 3pm"
- "Schedule a meeting with all designers for Wednesday at 2pm"
- "Schedule a meeting with Alice and Bob for tomorrow at 10am"
- "Schedule a meeting at his earliest available free time"

### Phase 3: UI Integration

**Planner & Actions Tab Integration**

#### Planner Tab Features:

- Schedule command detection and routing
- Conversation members loading with roles
- Meeting confirmation UI with details
- Conflict detection and warnings
- Success/error message display

#### Actions Tab Features:

- Upcoming meetings display
- Meeting cards with calendar icons
- Participant count and details
- Accept/Decline buttons (placeholder)
- Visual separation from action items

#### User Experience:

- Natural language input processing
- Real-time member role loading
- Comprehensive error handling
- Consistent UI styling

### Phase 4: Bug Fixes & Multi-User Support

**Critical Issues Resolution**

#### Major Bugs Fixed:

1. **Member Loading Issues**

   - Problem: Couldn't load member roles for scheduling
   - Solution: Inline member loading with default role population
   - Impact: Enabled role-based scheduling

2. **Multi-User Permissions**

   - Problem: Couldn't write to other users' schedules
   - Solution: Single-user storage (organizer only) for MVP
   - Impact: Simplified architecture, enabled basic functionality

3. **Firestore Index Missing**

   - Problem: Query required composite index
   - Solution: Added index + temporary client-side filtering
   - Impact: Enabled meeting retrieval

4. **Meeting Visibility**
   - Problem: Participants couldn't see meetings
   - Solution: Query all members' schedules, filter for participation
   - Impact: All participants now see meetings

#### Architecture Changes:

- Meetings stored in organizer's schedule only
- Query all members' schedules to show meetings
- Client-side filtering for participation
- Security rules compliance

### Phase 5: Cloud Functions & Multi-User Distribution

**Server-Side Meeting Management**

#### Cloud Functions Implemented:

1. **`casperCreateMeeting`**

   - Creates meeting events for ALL participants
   - Server-side admin privileges
   - Atomic batch writes
   - Status management (accepted/pending)

2. **`casperDeleteMeeting`**

   - Deletes meetings from all participants' schedules
   - Batch deletion for consistency
   - Real-time updates

3. **`casperUpdateMeetingStatus`**
   - Updates meeting status (pending/accepted/declined/done)
   - Individual user status management
   - Status synchronization

#### Client-Side Integration:

- Updated `createMeetingEvent()` to use Cloud Functions
- Real-time listeners for automatic updates
- Status badges and action buttons
- Multi-device synchronization

#### Benefits:

- ✅ Multi-user meeting creation
- ✅ Real-time updates across devices
- ✅ Individual meeting control
- ✅ Secure server-side operations
- ✅ Scalable architecture

### Phase 6+: Polish & Bug Fixes

**Final Refinements & Optimization**

#### Key Fixes:

1. **Display Name Synchronization**

   - Problem: Planner couldn't see updated display names
   - Solution: Always fetch fresh user data, sync across conversations
   - Impact: Name-based scheduling works reliably

2. **Real-Time Display Names**

   - Problem: Names not updating in real-time
   - Solution: Added Firestore listeners for user document changes
   - Impact: Instant name updates across all screens

3. **Name-Based Participant Parsing**

   - Problem: "with User B" commands failing
   - Solution: Fixed regex pattern with negative lookahead
   - Impact: All name-based commands now work

4. **Meeting Delete Errors**

   - Problem: Delete operations failing
   - Solution: Enhanced Cloud Function with proper error handling
   - Impact: Reliable meeting deletion

5. **Group Chat Deduplication**

   - Problem: Duplicate group chats created
   - Solution: Added deduplication logic
   - Impact: Clean group chat management

6. **Participant Count Consistency**
   - Problem: Inconsistent participant counts
   - Solution: Fixed participant matching logic
   - Impact: Accurate counts everywhere

#### UI/UX Improvements:

- Completed meetings section in Planner tab
- Read receipts for group chats
- Presence indicators
- Typing indicators
- Notification banners
