## 💻 Technical Details

### Component Used

**PresenceBadge**

- Location: `src/components/PresenceBadge.tsx`
- Hook: Uses `useUserPresence(userId)` for real-time tracking
- Sizes: small (8px), medium (12px), large (16px)
- Border: 2px white border for visibility

### Presence Tracking

**How it works:**

1. Firebase Realtime Database stores user presence
2. `useUserPresence` hook subscribes to user's status
3. Returns `{ online: boolean }`
4. PresenceBadge renders green or gray based on status

### Styling

```typescript
memberNameRow: {
  flexDirection: "row",
  alignItems: "center",
  gap: theme.spacing.sm,  // 8px gap between name and badge
  marginBottom: theme.spacing.xs,
}
```

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

✅ Presence badge appears next to each member name  
✅ Green indicates online, gray indicates offline  
✅ Updates in real-time without refresh  
✅ Works for all group members including current user  
✅ Maintains existing layout and spacing  
✅ No performance degradation  
✅ Consistent with presence badges elsewhere in app
