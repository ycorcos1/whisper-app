# Meeting Delete Error - Debug Setup Complete

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Status:** üîç DEBUGGING

---

## Issue

**Error:** "Error deleting meeting: FirebaseError: Failed to delete meeting"

**When:** User tries to delete a scheduled meeting

**Error Location:** Client-side error handling in `handleDeleteMeeting`

---

## Debug Setup Added

### ‚úÖ 1. Server-Side Debug Logging (Cloud Function)

**Enhanced `casperDeleteMeeting` with detailed logging:**

```typescript
functions.logger.info("Attempting to delete meeting", {
  eventId,
  userId,
  path: `schedules/${userId}/events/${eventId}`,
});

// Check if meeting exists
if (!userEventSnap.exists) {
  functions.logger.error("Meeting not found in user's schedule", {
    eventId,
    userId,
    path: `schedules/${userId}/events/${eventId}`,
  });
}

// Log meeting data found
functions.logger.info("Found meeting data", {
  eventId,
  userId,
  meetingData: {
    title: meetingData?.title,
    participants: meetingData?.participants,
    createdBy: meetingData?.createdBy,
  },
});
```

**What this shows:**

- Whether the meeting exists in the user's schedule
- What meeting data is found
- Participant information
- Batch delete operation details

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Client-Side Debug Logging

**Enhanced `deleteMeetingEvent` with logging:**

```typescript
console.log("üóëÔ∏è DEBUG: Attempting to delete meeting", { eventId });

const result = await deleteMeeting({ eventId });

console.log("üóëÔ∏è DEBUG: Delete meeting result", {
  eventId,
  success: data.success,
  message: data.message,
});
```

**What this shows:**

- Event ID being sent to Cloud Function
- Success/failure result from server
- Error details if deletion fails

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Enhanced Error Handling

**Added try-catch around batch commit:**

```typescript
try {
  await batch.commit();
  // Success logging
} catch (batchError) {
  functions.logger.error("Batch delete failed", {
    eventId,
    userId,
    participants,
    batchError,
  });
  throw batchError;
}
```

**What this shows:**

- Specific batch operation failures
- Which participants couldn't be deleted
- Detailed error information

---

## How to Debug

### Step 1: Try to Delete a Meeting

**Action:** Click "Delete" button on any meeting

### Step 2: Check Client Console Logs

**Look for:**

```
üóëÔ∏è DEBUG: Attempting to delete meeting { eventId: "meeting_123..." }
üóëÔ∏è DEBUG: Delete meeting result { eventId: "...", success: false, message: "..." }
```

### Step 3: Check Firebase Function Logs

**In Firebase Console ‚Üí Functions ‚Üí Logs:**

**Success case:**

```
Attempting to delete meeting
Found meeting data
Deleting meeting for all participants
Meeting deleted successfully for all
```

**Failure case:**

```
Attempting to delete meeting
Meeting not found in user's schedule
```

**Batch failure case:**

```
Batch delete failed
```

## Possible Root Causes

### 1. Meeting Not Found

**Problem:** Meeting doesn't exist in user's schedule
**Check:** Server logs show "Meeting not found in user's schedule"
**Cause:** Meeting was already deleted or never created properly

### 2. Permission Issue

**Problem:** User doesn't have permission to delete
**Check:** Server logs show authentication errors
**Cause:** User not authenticated or wrong user trying to delete

### 3. Batch Delete Failure

**Problem:** Firestore batch operation fails
**Check:** Server logs show "Batch delete failed"
**Cause:** Network issue, Firestore quota, or data corruption

### 4. Invalid Event ID

**Problem:** Event ID is malformed or doesn't exist
**Check:** Client logs show invalid event ID
**Cause:** UI passing wrong event ID

## Files Modified

### ‚úÖ functions/src/rag/meetings.ts

- Added detailed debug logging in `casperDeleteMeeting`
- Enhanced error handling for batch operations
- **Status:** Deployed to Firebase

### ‚úÖ src/agent/planner/scheduleService.ts

- Added client-side debug logging in `deleteMeetingEvent`
- Shows request/response details

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test delete operation**

   - Try to delete a meeting
   - Check both client and server logs

2. **Identify the issue**

   - Meeting not found?
   - Permission problem?
   - Batch operation failure?

3. **Fix the root cause**
   - Once we see the logs, we'll know exactly what's wrong

---

**Status:** üîç Ready to debug!

**Test it now:**

1. Try to delete a meeting
2. Check console logs (client) and Firebase Function logs (server)
3. Share the results to identify the exact issue!
