# Chat Settings Implementation

## Overview

Implemented a new **ChatSettingsScreen** that dynamically adapts based on conversation type (DM vs Group Chat), providing appropriate settings and actions for each type.

## Changes Summary

### 1. New Screen: ChatSettingsScreen.tsx

**Location:** `/src/screens/ChatSettingsScreen.tsx`

**Features:**

#### For Direct Messages (DMs):

- Displays other user's display name and email
- "Delete Conversation" button with confirmation dialog
- Local deletion only (doesn't affect other user's chat history)

#### For Group Chats:

- **Group Name Management:**
  - Display current group name
  - Edit group name with inline editing UI
  - Save/Cancel buttons for name changes
- **Member Management:**
  - List all members with display names and emails
  - Mark current user as "(You)"
  - "Remove" button for each member (except yourself)
  - Minimum 2 members enforced
- **Add Members:**
  - Search by email address
  - Validates user exists
  - Prevents duplicate additions
  - Loading state during addition
- **Leave Group:**
  - "Leave Group" button with confirmation
  - Removes current user from members list
  - Returns to Conversations screen after leaving

### 2. Updated Files

#### a. `/src/features/conversations/api.ts`

**Added Functions:**

- `updateGroupName(conversationId, groupName)` - Updates group chat name
- `addMembersToGroup(conversationId, userIds)` - Adds users to group
- `removeMemberFromGroup(conversationId, userId)` - Removes user from group
- `leaveGroup(conversationId)` - Current user leaves group
- `getUserByEmail(email)` - Finds user by email address

**Updated Interface:**

- Added `groupName?: string` to `ConversationDoc` interface

**Updated Function:**

- `subscribeToUserConversations()` - Now displays `groupName` if set, otherwise falls back to member names

#### b. `/src/screens/ChatScreen.tsx`

**Changes:**

- Replaced "Delete" button with circular "i" icon in header
- Icon navigates to ChatSettings screen
- Updated to display `groupName` for group chats when available
- Removed unused `deleteConversation` import
- Added back `Alert` import for error handling

**New Styles:**

- `headerButton` - Padding for header button
- `infoIcon` - Circular bordered icon style
- `infoIconText` - Italic "i" text styling

#### c. `/src/navigation/types.ts`

**Added Route:**

```typescript
ChatSettings: {
  conversationId: string;
}
```

#### d. `/src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx`

**Added Screen Registration:**

- Imported `ChatSettingsScreen`
- Registered screen with header configuration
- Consistent styling with other screens

### 3. Database Structure

#### Updated Conversation Document:

```typescript
{
  members: string[];
  type: "dm" | "group";
  groupName?: string;  // NEW: Optional group name
  lastMessage?: {...};
  updatedAt: Timestamp;
}
```

### 4. Security & Permissions

**Firestore Rules:**

- Existing rules already support conversation updates by members
- No rule changes needed
- Members can update `groupName` and `members` fields
- Security maintained through member validation

### 5. UI/UX Features

**Delete Conversation (DM):**

- Clear warning that deletion is local only
- Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletion
- Returns to Conversations screen after deletion

**Leave Group:**

- Confirmation dialog before leaving
- User removed from members array
- Returns to Conversations screen
- Group continues to exist for other members

**Group Rename:**

- Inline editing with Save/Cancel buttons
- Visual feedback on save
- Updates reflected immediately in:
  - Chat header
  - Conversations list
  - Settings screen

**Add Members:**

- Email-based search
- Validation for:
  - User existence
  - Duplicate prevention
  - Empty email handling
- Loading state during search/add
- Success confirmation

**Remove Members:**

- Individual remove buttons
- Cannot remove yourself (use Leave Group instead)
- Confirmation before removal
- Minimum 2 members enforced

### 6. Navigation Flow

```
Chat Screen
    ↓ (tap "i" icon)
Chat Settings Screen
    ↓ (actions)
    - Delete/Leave → Conversations Screen
    - Edit/Add/Remove → Stays in Settings (refreshes data)
    - Back button → Returns to Chat
```

### 7. Type Safety

All new code is fully type-safe:

- Route parameters properly typed
- API functions have explicit return types
- Component props use proper TypeScript interfaces
- No TypeScript compilation errors

### 8. Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling for:

- Failed API calls
- Network errors
- Invalid user input

All errors show user-friendly Alert dialogs.
