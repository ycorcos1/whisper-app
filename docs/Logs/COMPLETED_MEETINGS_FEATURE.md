# Completed Meetings in Plan History - Complete

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ FEATURE COMPLETE

---

## What Was Added

### Completed Meetings Section

Meetings marked as "done" now appear in a dedicated **"✅ Completed Meetings"** section in the Planner tab.

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. State Management

**Added:**

```typescript
const [completedMeetings, setCompletedMeetings] = useState<ScheduleEvent[]>([]);
```

This tracks completed meetings separately from upcoming meetings.

---

### 2. Real-Time Listener Update

**Modified the `onSnapshot` listener to separate meetings:**

**Before:**

```typescript
const upcomingMeetings = snapshot.docs.filter((meeting) => {
  return (
    meeting.startTime >= now && meeting.conversationId === state.context.cid
  );
});

setMeetings(upcomingMeetings);
```

**After:**

```typescript
const allMeetings = snapshot.docs.map(/* ... */);

// Separate upcoming and completed
const upcomingMeetings = allMeetings
  .filter((meeting) => {
    return (
      meeting.status !== "done" &&
      meeting.startTime >= now &&
      meeting.conversationId === state.context.cid
    );
  })
  .sort((a, b) => a.startTime.getTime() - b.startTime.getTime());

const completedMeetings = allMeetings
  .filter((meeting) => {
    return (
      meeting.status === "done" && meeting.conversationId === state.context.cid
    );
  })
  .sort((a, b) => b.startTime.getTime() - a.startTime.getTime()); // Most recent first

setMeetings(upcomingMeetings);
setCompletedMeetings(completedMeetings);
```

**Key Changes:**

- Upcoming meetings: `status !== "done"` and `startTime >= now`
- Completed meetings: `status === "done"` (any time)
- Completed meetings sorted by most recent first (descending)

---

### 3. UI Section

**Added new section after upcoming meetings:**

```typescript
{
  /* Completed Meetings */
}
{
  completedMeetings.length > 0 && (
    <View style={styles.meetingsSection}>
      <Text style={styles.sectionTitle}>
        ✅ Completed Meetings ({completedMeetings.length})
      </Text>
      {completedMeetings.map((meeting) => (
        <View key={meeting.id} style={styles.completedMeetingCard}>
          {/* Meeting details with green checkmark */}
          {/* Only organizer can delete */}
        </View>
      ))}
    </View>
  );
}
```

**Visual Differences from Upcoming Meetings:**

- ✅ Green checkmark icon instead of calendar icon
- 🎨 Slightly dimmed appearance (opacity: 0.8)
- 🏷️ "done" badge displayed
- 🗑️ Only shows "Delete" button (no "Mark Done")
- 🔒 Only organizer can delete

---

### 4. Styling

**Added:**

```typescript
completedMeetingCard: {
  backgroundColor: theme.colors.surface,
  borderRadius: theme.borderRadius.lg,
  padding: theme.spacing.md,
  marginBottom: theme.spacing.md,
  borderWidth: 1,
  borderColor: theme.colors.border,
  opacity: 0.8, // Slightly dimmed to show it's completed
}
```

The dimmed appearance (80% opacity) provides visual feedback that the meeting is in the past.

---

## User Experience

### Planner Tab Layout

**Order of sections:**

1. **Query Input** - Schedule new meetings
2. **Upcoming Meetings** - Future meetings (not done)
3. **✅ Completed Meetings** - Past meetings marked as done
4. **Current Plan** - Active planning tasks
5. **Plan History** - Past plans

---

### Workflow

#### 1. Create Meeting

```
User A: "Schedule with everyone for tomorrow at 2pm"
→ Meeting appears in "📅 Your Scheduled Meetings" section
→ Shows [Mark Done] [Delete] buttons (organizer only)
```

#### 2. Mark as Done

```
User A clicks [Mark Done]
→ Meeting moves to "✅ Completed Meetings" section
→ Only shows [Delete] button now
→ Card is dimmed (80% opacity)
```

#### 3. View Completed

```
All users can see completed meetings in their Planner tab
→ Shows when it was scheduled (past date)
→ Shows who attended (participant count)
→ Shows "done" badge
```

#### 4. Delete Completed (Organizer Only)

```
User A clicks [Delete] on completed meeting
→ Meeting removed from ALL participants' schedules
→ Disappears from everyone's Planner tab (real-time)
```

- ✅ All users see it move to completed section (real-time)

---

2. Mark all 3 as done at different times

**Expected:**

---

---

### Test 4: Non-Organizer View

1. User A creates and marks meeting as done
2. User B opens Planner tab

**Expected:**

- ✅ User B sees completed meeting
- ✅ User B does NOT see [Delete] button
- ✅ Meeting is read-only for User B

---

### Test 5: Past Meeting Not Marked Done

**Steps:**

2. Wait until tomorrow (or change device date)
3. Don't mark it as done

**Expected:**
