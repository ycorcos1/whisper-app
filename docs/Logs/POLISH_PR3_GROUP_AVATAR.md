# Group Chat Avatar Feature

**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Feature:** Group chat avatars with multiple user avatars displayed in a cluster

---

## 🎨 What Was Built

### Visual Design

Group chat avatars now display multiple user avatars (up to 4) arranged in a circular cluster pattern:

- **1 member**: Single centered avatar
- **2 members**: Side by side, slightly overlapping
- **3 members**: Triangle formation (1 top, 2 bottom)
- **4 members**: 2x2 grid formation

This creates a visually distinct look for group chats compared to DMs.

---

## 📦 Implementation

### 1. Updated ConversationListItem Type

**File:** `src/features/conversations/api.ts`

Added new fields to track conversation type and member information:

```typescript
export interface ConversationListItem {
  // ... existing fields
  type: "dm" | "group"; // Conversation type
  members?: Array<{
    // For group chats, member info for avatar display
    userId: string;
    displayName: string;
    photoURL?: string | null;
  }>;
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Conversation Subscription

**File:** `src/features/conversations/api.ts`

Modified `subscribeToUserConversations` to:

- Fetch member information for group chats (up to 4 members)
- Include display names and photo URLs
- Filter out current user from member list
- Return type information with each conversation

### 3. Created GroupAvatar Component

**File:** `src/components/GroupAvatar.tsx`

New component that:

- Displays multiple user avatars in a cluster
- Supports 1-4 members
- Uses intelligent positioning based on member count
- Includes border styling for visual separation
- Reuses existing Avatar component for consistency

**Features:**

- Responsive sizing (small, medium, large)
- Automatic avatar positioning
- White borders between avatars for clarity
- Circular container matching existing avatar style

### 4. Updated ConversationsScreen

**File:** `src/screens/ConversationsScreen.tsx`

Modified conversation rendering to:

- Check conversation type (DM vs group)
- Display GroupAvatar for groups with members
- Display regular Avatar for DMs
- Maintain presence badge for DMs only

## 🎯 Avatar Positioning Logic

### 1 Member

```
    [A]
```

- Centered in container

### 2 Members

```
  [A][B]
```

- Side by side with 25% overlap
- Vertically centered

### 3 Members

```
    [A]
  [B] [C]
```

- Triangle formation
- Top avatar centered
- Bottom two avatars at corners

### 4 Members

```
  [A][B]
  [C][D]
```

- 2x2 grid formation
- All avatars overlap slightly
- Evenly distributed

## 💻 Technical Details

### Avatar Sizing

```typescript
CONTAINER_SIZES = {
  small: 32px,
  medium: 40px,
  large: 60px,
}

AVATAR_SIZES = {
  small: "small",   // Individual avatars
  medium: "small",   // Individual avatars
  large: "medium",  // Individual avatars
}
```

**Why smaller avatars?** When displaying multiple avatars in a group, we use smaller individual avatars to fit them all within the same container size as a single DM avatar.

### Overlap Calculation

```typescript
const offset = avatarSizePixels * 0.25; // 25% overlap
```

This creates a visually pleasing cluster without avatars being too spread out or too cramped.

### Border Styling

```typescript
borderWidth: 1.5,
borderColor: theme.colors.background,
```

White borders between avatars provide visual separation and match the app's design system.

## 🎨 Visual Comparison

### Before

- Group chats: Single generic avatar (first member or fallback)
- No visual distinction between DMs and groups

### After

- Group chats: Cluster of member avatars
- Clear visual distinction
- More informative at a glance
- Matches modern messaging app patterns (WhatsApp, Messenger, etc.)

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Scenarios

1. **Group with 1 member (edge case)**

   - Should display single avatar centered

2. **Group with 2 members**

   - Should display side by side
   - Slight overlap visible

3. **Group with 3 members**

   - Should display triangle formation
   - Top and bottom rows visible

4. **Group with 4+ members**

   - Should display 2x2 grid
   - Shows first 4 members only

5. **DM conversations**

   - Should still display single avatar
   - Presence badge should work

6. **Mixed conversation list**
   - DMs and groups should be visually distinct
   - All avatars should load properly

### Edge Cases

- **No photo URLs**: Falls back to initials with colored background
- **Loading images**: Shows initials while loading
- **Failed image loads**: Shows initials on error
- **Empty member list**: Falls back to single avatar

---

## 📊 Performance

### Optimizations

1. **Limited member fetch**: Only fetches first 4 members
2. **Parallel requests**: Uses `Promise.all` for member data
3. **Efficient positioning**: CSS-based positioning, no animations
4. **Reuses Avatar component**: No duplicate code

### Impact

- Minimal performance impact
- Slightly longer initial load for group conversations (member fetching)
- Acceptable trade-off for improved UX

---

## 🎯 User Benefits

1. **Visual Distinction**: Easy to identify group chats vs DMs at a glance
2. **Member Preview**: See who's in the group without opening it
3. **Modern UX**: Matches user expectations from other messaging apps
4. **Consistent Design**: Uses existing avatar styling and colors

## 🔄 Files Changed

### New Files

- `src/components/GroupAvatar.tsx` - New component

### Modified Files

- `src/features/conversations/api.ts` - Type updates, member fetching
- `src/screens/ConversationsScreen.tsx` - Conditional avatar rendering

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

✅ Group chats display multiple avatars (up to 4)  
✅ Avatars arranged in circular cluster pattern  
✅ DM conversations unchanged (single avatar + presence)  
✅ Avatars show user photos or colored initials  
✅ Consistent sizing with existing avatars  
✅ No performance degradation  
✅ Works on all conversation list items

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

1. **More than 4 members**: Show "+N" badge for large groups
2. **Animated transitions**: Smooth avatar appearance/disappearance
3. **Custom group avatars**: Allow setting a custom photo for the group
4. **Long press preview**: Show full member list on long press
5. **Reordering**: Show most active/recent members first
