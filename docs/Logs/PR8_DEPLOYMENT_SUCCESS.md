## üß™ Ready to Test!

Your image messaging feature is now live and ready to test. Here's what to do:

### Quick Test (5 minutes)

1. **Launch the App**

   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   expo start
   ```

2. **Basic Upload Test**

   - Open any chat conversation
   - Tap the üì∑ camera button
   - Grant media library permission (if prompted)
   - Select an image from your device
   - **Expected:** Upload progress bar ‚Üí Image appears in chat

3. **Thumbnail Generation Test**

   - After sending an image, wait 5 seconds
   - The thumbnail should generate automatically
   - Check Firebase Console Storage:
     - Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/whisper-app-aa915/storage
     - Navigate to `message_media/{conversationId}/`
     - **Expected:** You'll see both `{messageId}/original.jpg` and `{messageId}_thumb.jpg`

4. **Full-Screen Viewer Test**
   - Tap on any image in the chat
   - **Expected:** Full-screen modal opens
   - Tap ‚úï to close
   - **Expected:** Returns to chat

### Monitor Cloud Function Logs

To see thumbnail generation in real-time:

```bash
firebase functions:log
```

**Expected Log Output:**

```
Processing image for thumbnail
Downloaded original image
Generated thumbnail
Uploaded thumbnail
Thumbnail URL: https://storage.googleapis.com/...
Updated message with thumbnail URL
Cleaned up temp files
```

- [ ] **Close Viewer** - Tap ‚úï returns to chat
- [ ] **Error Handling** - Try >10MB file, see error message
- [ ] **Group Chat** - Send image in group, displays correctly
- [ ] **Delivery Status** - Image messages show status indicators
- [ ] **Multiple Images** - Send multiple images, all render properly
- [ ] **Thumbnail Loading** - Reload chat, thumbnails load quickly

## üîç Monitoring & Debugging

### View Function Logs

```bash
# All function logs
firebase functions:log

# Specific function logs
firebase functions:log --only generateThumbnail
```

### Check Function Status

```bash
firebase functions:list
```

### View Storage Files

Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/whisper-app-aa915/storage

### Check Firestore Messages

Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/whisper-app-aa915/firestore

Navigate to: `conversations/{cid}/messages/{mid}`

**Expected Fields:**

```javascript
{
  senderId: "user123",
  type: "image",
  image: {
    url: "https://storage.googleapis.com/.../original.jpg",
    thumbnailUrl: "https://storage.googleapis.com/.../_thumb.jpg"
  },
  timestamp: Timestamp,
  status: "sent"
}
```

---

## üìà Performance Expectations

### Upload Times

- Small images (<1MB): 1-2 seconds
- Medium images (1-5MB): 3-5 seconds
- Large images (5-10MB): 5-10 seconds

### Thumbnail Generation

- Processing time: 3-5 seconds after upload completes
- Original image shows immediately
- Thumbnail replaces original once generated

### Storage Costs (Estimated)

- Images: ~$0.026 per GB/month
- Function invocations: Free tier = 2M invocations/month
- Network egress: First 1 GB/month free

**Note:** Development usage typically stays within free tier limits.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Image Won't Upload

**Check:**

1. Internet connection is active
2. Firebase Storage is enabled in console
3. Storage rules are deployed
4. User is authenticated

**Debug:**

```javascript
// In app, check console for errors
console.log("Upload error:", error.message);
```

### Thumbnails Not Generating

**Check:**

1. Cloud Function is deployed: `firebase functions:list`
2. Function logs: `firebase functions:log`
3. Original image uploaded to correct path: `message_media/{cid}/{mid}/original.*`

**Expected Log Entry:**

```
Processing image for thumbnail
conversationId: abc123
messageId: msg456
```

### Permission Errors

**Check:**

1. Media library permission granted in device settings
2. User is logged in
3. Storage rules allow authenticated access

**Fix:** Prompt user to grant permission in Settings

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria - All Met!

- ‚úÖ Storage rules deployed
- ‚úÖ Cloud Functions deployed and active
- ‚úÖ `generateThumbnail` function monitoring Storage uploads
- ‚úÖ `helloWorld` function accessible via HTTPS
- ‚úÖ TypeScript build successful
- ‚úÖ No deployment errors
- ‚úÖ Functions running in correct region (us-central1)
- ‚úÖ Proper runtime (Node.js 18)

---

## üöÄ What's Next?

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Test the feature** using the checklist above
2. **Monitor the logs** during first image upload
3. **Verify thumbnails** appear in Storage console
4. **Check Firestore** for thumbnail URL updates

### Optional: Set Up Cleanup Policy

The deployment warning mentioned setting up a cleanup policy for old container images. This is optional but recommended for production:

```bash
firebase functions:artifacts:setpolicy
```

This prevents old function builds from accumulating in Artifact Registry.

---

## üìù Notes

### TypeScript Configuration Fix

Updated `functions/tsconfig.json` to prevent conflicts with React Native types:

- Added `skipLibCheck: true`
- Added `types: ["node"]`
- Excluded parent `node_modules` and `src` directories

### Runtime Notice

Node.js 18 is deprecated but still supported until October 2025. Consider upgrading to Node.js 20 in a future PR.
