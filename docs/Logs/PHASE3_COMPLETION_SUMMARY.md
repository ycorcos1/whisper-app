# Phase 3: UI Integration - COMPLETE ✅

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Overview

Phase 3 completes the meeting scheduler by integrating the scheduling infrastructure (Phase 2) with the user interface. Users can now schedule meetings using natural language commands in the Planner tab and view upcoming meetings in the Actions tab.

---

## Components Implemented

### 1. ✅ Planner Tab Integration

**File:** `src/agent/CasperTabs/Planner.tsx`

**Features Implemented:**

1. **Schedule Command Detection**

   - Detects if user query is a schedule command
   - Routes to scheduling workflow instead of plan creation
   - Uses `isScheduleCommand()` function

2. **Conversation Members Loading**

   - Loads members with roles from `/conversations/{cid}/members`
   - Caches member data for performance
   - Supports both DM and group chat contexts

3. **Scheduling Workflow**

   - Parses command using `handleScheduleCommand()`
   - Validates participants and date/time
   - Checks for scheduling conflicts
   - Creates meeting events for all participants

4. **Meeting Confirmation UI**
   - Success card with meeting details:
     - Meeting title
     - Date and time
     - Duration
     - Participant count
   - Error display with clear messages
   - Dismiss button to clear confirmation

**User Flow:**

```
1. User enters: "Schedule a meeting with all designers for wednesday at 2pm"
2. System detects schedule command
3. Loads conversation members
4. Matches "designers" to users with role="Design"
5. Parses "wednesday at 2pm" to date/time
6. Checks for conflicts
7. Creates meeting events
8. Displays success confirmation
```

---

### 2. ✅ Actions Tab Integration

**File:** `src/agent/CasperTabs/Actions.tsx`

**Features Implemented:**

1. **Meetings Section**

   - Loads upcoming meetings on mount
   - Displays meetings above action items
   - Shows meeting count in section header
   - Refreshes with pull-to-refresh

2. **Meeting Cards**

   - Calendar icon with meeting title
   - Date/time display (formatted)
   - Duration display
   - Participant count
   - Accept/Decline buttons (TODO: implement actions)

3. **Visual Design**
   - Distinct meeting cards with calendar icon
   - Color-coded action buttons (green/red)
   - Clear separation from regular action items
   - Section titles with emoji indicators

**Display Example:**

```
📅 Upcoming Meetings (2)

┌────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📅 Design Team Sync            │
│                                │
│ 🕐 Wednesday, Oct 30 at 2:00 PM│
│ ⏱️ 60 minutes                  │
│ 👥 3 participant(s)            │
│                                │
│ [✓ Accept]  [✗ Decline]       │
└────────────────────────────────┘

4. **No Recurring Meetings**

   - Each meeting must be scheduled individually

5. **No Meeting Updates**
   - Can't reschedule or edit existing meetings
   - Must create new meeting

### Future Enhancements:
