# Display Name Flickering Fix + Role/Name Scheduling - Complete

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ Issue 1: Display Name Flickering on ChatScreen

**Problem:** Names were flickering/refreshing constantly when viewing chat

**Root Cause:** The `onSnapshot` listener was updating state on EVERY snapshot event, even when the name hadn't changed

**Fix:** Added comparison checks before updating state

```typescript
// Only update if name actually changed
const currentName = senderNamesRef.current[memberId];
if (currentName !== displayName) {
  // Update state
}
```

---

### ✅ Issue 2: Display Names Not Updating on ChatSettingsScreen

**Problem:** Names weren't updating at all in the settings screen

**Root Cause:** State was being overwritten unconditionally, causing React to not detect changes properly

**Fix:** Used functional setState with comparison

```typescript
setOtherUserDisplayName((prev) => {
  if (prev !== displayName) {
    return displayName;
  }
  return prev; // No change, prevent re-render
});
```

---

### ✅ Issue 3: Role-Based Scheduling Not Working

**Problem:** Commands like "schedule with the designers" were failing with "Failed to parse command"

**Root Cause:** Role extraction only looked for "all {role}" patterns, missing variations like:

- "the designers"
- "designers"
- "the PMs"
- "PM"

**Fix:** Updated role extraction patterns

```typescript
const rolePatterns = [
  /(?:all\s+)?(?:the\s+)?(\w+s)\b/gi, // Plural: "designers", "the engineers"
  /(?:all\s+)?(?:the\s+)?(pm|se|qa)\b/gi, // Short: "PM", "SE", "QA"
];
```

---

### ✅ Issue 4: PM/Manager Aliases

**Problem:** "PM" should refer to project/product managers or simply "managers"

**Fix:** Updated role aliases

```typescript
PM: ["pm", "pms", "project manager", "product manager", "manager", "managers"];
```

---

## What Works Now

### Role-Based Scheduling

**All these commands now work:**

| Command                           | Matches        |
| --------------------------------- | -------------- |
| "schedule with the designers"     | ✅ Design role |
| "schedule with designers"         | ✅ Design role |
| "schedule with all the designers" | ✅ Design role |
| "schedule with the PMs"           | ✅ PM role     |
| "schedule with PM"                | ✅ PM role     |
| "schedule with managers"          | ✅ PM role     |
| "schedule with the engineers"     | ✅ SE role     |
| "schedule with developers"        | ✅ SE role     |
| "schedule with the QA team"       | ✅ QA role     |

### Name-Based Scheduling

**Multiple names separated by commas:**

| Command                                 | Result         |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| "schedule with Adam for tomorrow"       | ✅ Finds Adam  |
| "schedule with Adam and Bob for Friday" | ✅ Finds both  |
| "schedule with Alice, Bob, and Charlie" | ✅ Finds all 3 |

### Display Names

**No more flickering:**

- ✅ ChatScreen: Names update smoothly when changed
- ✅ ChatSettingsScreen: Names update properly
- ✅ No unnecessary re-renders
- ✅ Only updates when data actually changes

**5b. Role + Time**

```
"schedule with the design team for next Monday at 2pm"
```

---

## Debug Logs to Check

When you run a scheduling command, you should see:

```
🔍 DEBUG: extractNameParticipants
🔍 Checking role text: "designers"
✅ Matched role: designers → Design
🔍 DEBUG: parseScheduleCommand
🔍 DEBUG: Participant matching
matchedCount: 2  ← Should show correct count
```

If matching fails, logs will show which step failed.
