# Phase 5: Cloud Functions for Multi-User Meetings - COMPLETE

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Feature:** Server-side meeting creation for all participants  
**Status:** ✅ DEPLOYED

---

## Summary

Implemented **Cloud Functions** with admin privileges to create meetings for ALL participants. Meetings now appear in everyone's Planner tab, and users can delete or mark meetings as done.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. ✅ Cloud Functions (Server-Side)

**File:** `functions/src/rag/meetings.ts`

Three new Cloud Functions:

#### `casperCreateMeeting`

- **Purpose:** Create meeting events for ALL participants
- **Runs with admin privileges** - can write to any user's schedule
- **Creates events atomically** using Firestore batch writes
- **Sets status:** "accepted" for organizer, "pending" for others
- **Returns:** `eventId`, `participantIds`, success message

#### `casperDeleteMeeting`

- **Purpose:** Delete a meeting from user's schedule
- **Validates:** User is authenticated
- **Returns:** Success message

#### `casperUpdateMeetingStatus`

- **Purpose:** Update meeting status (pending/accepted/declined/done)
- **Validates:** Status is valid
- **Updates:** User's copy of the meeting
- **Returns:** New status, success message

### 2. ✅ Client-Side Integration

**File:** `src/agent/planner/scheduleService.ts`

#### Updated `createMeetingEvent()`

```typescript
// OLD: Direct Firestore write (only organizer's schedule)
await setDoc(eventRef, eventData); // ❌ Only creates for organizer

// NEW: Cloud Function call (all participants' schedules)
const createMeeting = httpsCallable(functions, "casperCreateMeeting");
const result = await createMeeting({
  conversationId,
  participantIds,
  title,
  startTime: startTime.toISOString(),
  duration,
}); // ✅ Creates for ALL participants!
```

#### New Functions:

- `deleteMeetingEvent(eventId)` - Calls `casperDeleteMeeting`
- `updateMeetingStatus(eventId, status)` - Calls `casperUpdateMeetingStatus`

### 3. ✅ Enhanced UI

**File:** `src/agent/CasperTabs/Planner.tsx`

#### New Features:

1. **Status Badges** - Visual indicators for meeting status

   - Green badge for "done"
   - Purple badge for "accepted"
   - Red badge for "declined"
   - Gray badge for "pending"

2. **Action Buttons**

   - "Mark Done" button (green) - Updates status to "done"
   - "Delete" button (red) - Removes meeting from schedule
   - "Mark Done" hidden if status is already "done"

3. **Auto-refresh** after actions
   - Meetings reload after marking as done
   - Meetings reload after deleting

#### Updated Meeting Card:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🕒 Team Meeting    [ACCEPTED]      │
│                                    │
│ 🕐 Friday, Oct 24 at 5:00 PM      │
│ ⏱️ 60 minutes                      │
│ 👥 3 participant(s)                │
│                                    │
│ [✓ Mark Done]     [🗑️ Delete]     │
└────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 4. ✅ Type Updates

**File:** `src/types/casper.ts`

Extended `ScheduleEvent` status to include "done":

```typescript
status?: "pending" | "accepted" | "declined" | "done";
```

---

## How It Works Now

### Scenario: Alice schedules a meeting with Bob and Carol

**Step 1: Alice creates meeting**

```
Alice (Planner tab): "Schedule a meeting with everyone for tomorrow at 2pm"
```

**Step 2: Cloud Function executes**

```typescript
// Server-side (with admin privileges)
for (const userId of ["alice", "bob", "carol"]) {
  await admin
    .firestore()
    .doc(`schedules/${userId}/events/meeting_123`)
    .set({
      title: "Team Meeting",
      startTime: tomorrow_2pm,
      duration: 60,
      participants: ["alice", "bob", "carol"],
      createdBy: "alice",
      status: userId === "alice" ? "accepted" : "pending",
    });
}
```

**Step 3: All participants see the meeting**

- ✅ Alice opens Planner → Meeting shown with "accepted" badge
- ✅ Bob opens Planner → Meeting shown with "pending" badge
- ✅ Carol opens Planner → Meeting shown with "pending" badge

**Step 4: Bob marks as done**

```
Bob clicks "Mark Done" button
→ Cloud Function updates Bob's copy to status="done"
→ Meeting reloads with green "done" badge
```

**Step 5: Carol deletes**

```
Carol clicks "Delete" button
→ Cloud Function deletes Carol's copy
→ Meeting removed from Carol's Planner
→ Alice and Bob still have their copies
```

## Benefits

### ✅ Multi-User Support

- **Before:** Only organizer saw meetings
- **After:** ALL participants see meetings in their Planner

### ✅ Individual Control

- Each user has their own copy of the meeting
- Users can delete without affecting others
- Users can mark as done independently
- Status changes are personal

### ✅ Secure

- Cloud Functions run with admin privileges
- Client-side security rules still protect user data
- Validated user authentication
- Atomic batch writes prevent partial failures

### ✅ Scalable

- Works for any number of participants
- Efficient batched writes
- No cascading client-side operations

---

## New Commands Supported

### 1. Schedule with Everyone

```
"Schedule a meeting with everyone for tomorrow at 2pm"
```

**Result:** Meeting created for ALL members in the conversation

### 2. Schedule with Specific Users (by name)

```
"Schedule a meeting with Alice and Bob for Friday at 3pm"
```

**Result:** Meeting created for Alice, Bob, and the organizer

### 3. Schedule with Roles

```
"Schedule a meeting with all designers for Wednesday at 2pm"
```

**Result:** Meeting created for all users with role="Design" + organizer

### 4. Mark as Done

```
User clicks "Mark Done" button in Planner
```

**Result:** Meeting status updated to "done", badge turns green

### 5. Delete Meeting

```
User clicks "Delete" button in Planner
```

**Result:** Meeting removed from user's Planner (doesn't affect others)

---

## Technical Details

### Firestore Data Structure

**For each participant:**

```
/schedules/{userId}/events/{eventId}
  - title: "Team Meeting"
  - startTime: Timestamp(2025-10-24T17:00:00Z)
  - duration: 60
  - participants: ["alice", "bob", "carol"]
  - createdBy: "alice"
  - conversationId: "conv_xyz"
  - status: "pending" | "accepted" | "declined" | "done"
  - createdAt: Timestamp
  - updatedAt: Timestamp
```

**Key Points:**

- Each user has their OWN copy
- eventId is the SAME for all copies (allows tracking)
- status is INDEPENDENT per user
- Deleting only removes YOUR copy

### Security Rules (Unchanged)

```javascript
match /schedules/{userId}/events/{eventId} {
  allow read: if isAuthenticated() && isOwner(userId);
  allow write: if isAuthenticated() && isOwner(userId);
}
```

**Why this works:**

- Cloud Functions bypass these rules (admin privileges)
- Users can still read/write their own schedules
- Users CANNOT read/write others' schedules

### Cloud Function Permissions

**Deployment:**

- Functions deployed with admin SDK
- `admin.initializeApp()` grants full Firestore access
- Authenticated via service account

**Runtime Security:**

```typescript
// Verify user is authenticated
if (!context.auth) {
  throw new functions.https.HttpsError("unauthenticated", "...");
}

// Use authenticated user ID
const createdBy = context.auth.uid;
```

## Migration Notes

### Existing Meetings

**Old meetings (created before this update):**

- Still exist in organizer's schedule only
- Will load and display normally
- Can be deleted/marked as done

**New meetings (created after this update):**

- Created for all participants automatically
- Support full feature set

**No data migration needed!** Old and new meetings coexist seamlessly.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Meeting doesn't appear for participant

**Check:**

1. Was participant in conversation when meeting was created?
2. Did participant open Planner tab? (meetings load on mount)
3. Try pull-to-refresh in Planner tab
4. Check Firebase Console → Firestore → `/schedules/{participantId}/events`

**Solution:** Recreate the meeting

### Issue: "Failed to create meeting" error

**Check:**

1. Is user authenticated? (`firebaseAuth.currentUser`)
2. Are Cloud Functions deployed? (check Firebase Console)
3. Do you have network connection?
4. Check browser/app console for detailed error

**Solution:** Redeploy functions, check network, verify authentication

### Issue: Delete button doesn't work

**Check:**

1. Does event exist in `/schedules/{userId}/events/{eventId}`?
2. Is user authenticated?
3. Check browser console for errors

**Solution:** Refresh app, check authentication, verify Cloud Function is deployed
