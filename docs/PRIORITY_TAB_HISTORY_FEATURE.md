# Priority Tab: History Feature Implementation

**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Completed

---

## Summary

Updated the Priority tab to replace the "Show Done" toggle with a dedicated "History" button that switches between viewing active priority messages and completed (done) messages. Also fixed the group chat name display issue.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Group Chat Names

**Problem:**

- Group chats were showing "Unnamed Conversation" even when they had names
- The code was checking for `convData.name` instead of `convData.groupName`

**Solution:**

```typescript
// Before
conversationName = convData.name || "Unnamed Conversation";

// After
conversationName = convData.groupName || "Unnamed Conversation";
```

**Files Modified:**

- `src/agent/CasperTabs/Priority.tsx`

---

### 2. History Button Feature

**Replaced:** "Show Done" / "Hide Done" toggle  
**With:** "History" / "Back" button

#### UI Changes

**Active Messages View (Default):**

- Title: 🔴 Priority Messages
- Button: "History" with 📜 icon
- Shows: Only pending (not done) messages
- Empty state: "No Urgent Messages!"

**History View:**

- Title: 📜 Priority History
- Button: "Back" with ← icon
- Shows: Only completed (done) messages
- Empty state: "No History Yet"

#### Code Changes

**State Variable:**

```typescript
// Before
const [showDone, setShowDone] = useState(false);

// After
const [showHistory, setShowHistory] = useState(false);
```

**Filter Logic:**

```typescript
// Before: Toggle between all messages and pending only
const filteredMessages = showDone
  ? messages
  : messages.filter((msg) => !msg.isDone);

// After: Switch between pending and done only
const filteredMessages = showHistory
  ? messages.filter((msg) => msg.isDone) // History: only done
  : messages.filter((msg) => !msg.isDone); // Active: only pending
```

**Header Button:**

```typescript
<TouchableOpacity
  style={styles.historyButton}
  onPress={() => setShowHistory(!showHistory)}
>
  <MaterialCommunityIcons
    name={showHistory ? "arrow-left" : "history"}
    size={20}
    color={theme.colors.amethystGlow}
  />
  <Text style={styles.historyButtonText}>
    {showHistory ? "Back" : "History"}
  </Text>
</TouchableOpacity>
```

## User Experience Flow

### Default View (Active Messages)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🔴 Priority Messages         [📜 History]  │
│ 3 urgent or important messages              │
│ Last 30 days • Pull down to refresh         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ [Priority Message Cards]                    │
│ - Each with "Mark as Done" button           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### History View

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📜 Priority History             [← Back]    │
│ 5 completed messages                        │
│ Last 30 days • Pull down to refresh         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ [Done Message Cards]                        │
│ - Dimmed appearance (60% opacity)           │
│ - Each with "Mark as Pending" button        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

## Empty States

### No Active Messages

```
✓ (green check icon)

No Urgent Messages!

All 5 priority messages marked as done!
Check History to see them.

Detected patterns:
• "URGENT", "ASAP", "CRITICAL"
• Multiple exclamation marks (!!!)
• "by EOD", "by tomorrow"
• ALL CAPS MESSAGES
```

### No History (Never Marked Any Done)

```
📜 (history icon, gray)

No History Yet

You haven't marked any priority messages as done yet.
```

---

## Benefits

### ✅ Clearer Separation

- Active and completed messages are now completely separate views
- No confusion about what the toggle does

### ✅ Better Mental Model

- "History" is more intuitive than "Show Done"
- Back button clearly indicates returning to main view

### ✅ Focused Workflow

- Default view shows only what needs attention
- History is intentionally secondary (requires explicit navigation)

### ✅ Visual Feedback

- Icon changes (🔴 ↔️ 📜)
- Button text changes (History ↔️ Back)
- Subtitle updates ("urgent or important" ↔️ "completed")

---

## Technical Details

**Files Modified:**

- `src/agent/CasperTabs/Priority.tsx`

**Key Functions:**

- `loadPriorityMessages()` - Fixed to use `groupName` instead of `name`
- Filter logic - Changed to show mutually exclusive sets
- Header render - Dynamic title and button based on `showHistory`
- Empty states - Conditional rendering based on view mode

**Styles Added:**

- `historyButton` - Same style as old `filterToggle`
- `historyButtonText` - Same style as old `filterToggleText`

**Persistence:**

- Done message IDs still saved to AsyncStorage
- History state (active/history view) is NOT persisted (always starts at active)

---

## Impact

This change makes the Priority tab more user-friendly and aligns with the overall goal of making Casper AI useful for the "Remote Team Professional" persona by:

1. **Reducing cognitive load** - Clear separation between what needs action vs. what's done
2. **Improving focus** - Default view shows only actionable items
3. **Better organization** - History serves as an audit trail without cluttering main view
4. **Intuitive navigation** - "History" button is self-explanatory

---

## Next Steps

Consider:

1. Adding timestamps to history items ("Completed 2 hours ago")
2. Search/filter within history
3. Bulk actions (clear all history, mark all as pending)
4. Export history to external tool

**Status:** Ready for testing ✅
