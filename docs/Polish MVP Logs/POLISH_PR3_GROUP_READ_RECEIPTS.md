# Polish PR #3 â€” Group Chat Read Receipts

**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Status:** âœ… Implementation Complete  
**Feature:** Group chat read receipts with "seen by" labels

---

## ðŸ“¦ What Was Built

### 1. Read Receipts Data Structure

**File:** `src/features/messages/readReceipts.ts`

Created a new Firestore subcollection structure for tracking read receipts:

- **Collection Path:** `conversations/{conversationId}/participants/{userId}`
- **Fields:**
  - `userId`: User ID of the participant
  - `lastReadMid`: Message ID of the last message this user has read
  - `updatedAt`: Timestamp of when this was last updated

**Key Functions:**

- `updateLastReadMessage(conversationId, messageId)`: Updates the current user's last read message
- `subscribeToReadReceipts(conversationId, callback, onError)`: Real-time subscription to all participants' read status

---

### 2. Read Receipts Hook

**File:** `src/features/messages/useReadReceipts.ts`

Created a custom React hook for subscribing to read receipts:

- Automatically subscribes/unsubscribes based on conversation ID
- Returns array of participant read statuses
- Handles errors gracefully

---

### 3. ReadReceipts Component

**File:** `src/components/ReadReceipts.tsx`

New UI component for displaying "seen by" labels:

**Features:**

- Shows "seen by" followed by comma-separated list of users
- Only displays if at least one user has seen the message
- Limited to left half of screen width (maxWidth: 50%)
- Expandable/collapsible if names overflow one line
- Touch interaction only enabled when overflow exists
- Elegant styling with italicized "seen by" label

**Behavior:**

- If no users have seen the message â†’ no label displayed
- If names fit in one line â†’ static display
- If names overflow â†’ tap to expand/collapse

---

### 4. MessageItem Integration

**File:** `src/components/MessageItem.tsx`

Updated the MessageItem component to display read receipts:

- Added optional `seenByNames` prop (array of user names)
- Read receipts appear below the message bubble
- Only shown for group chats (not DMs)
- Maintains existing message bubble styling and layout

---

### 5. ChatScreen Updates

**File:** `src/screens/ChatScreen.tsx`

Integrated read receipts into the chat screen:

**Changes:**

1. **Import read receipts functionality:**

   - `useReadReceipts` hook
   - `updateLastReadMessage` function

2. **Subscribe to read receipts:**

   - Automatically subscribes when conversation loads
   - Only active for the current conversation

3. **Update last read message:**

   - When user views messages, update their `lastReadMid`
   - Happens automatically after 1 second of viewing
   - Only for group chats (DMs unchanged)

4. **Calculate read receipts per message:**
   - In `renderMessage`, filter users who have read each specific message
   - Map user IDs to display names
   - Pass to MessageItem for display

---

### 6. Firestore Security Rules

**File:** `firestore.rules`

Added security rules for the new participants subcollection:

```javascript
// Participants subcollection (for read receipts in group chats)
match /participants/{participantId} {
  // Users can read participants in conversations they're members of
  allow read: if isAuthenticated() && isMember(get(/databases/$(database)/documents/conversations/$(conversationId)).data);

  // Users can only update their own participant document
  allow create, update: if isAuthenticated()
    && isMember(get(/databases/$(database)/documents/conversations/$(conversationId)).data)
    && participantId == request.auth.uid
    && request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;

  // Users cannot delete participant documents
  allow delete: if false;
}
```

**Security Guarantees:**

- Users can only update their own read status
- Users must be members of the conversation to access participants
- Read receipts are read-only for other users
- No deletion allowed (audit trail maintained)

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Behaviors

### Group Chats

1. **When a user views messages:**

   - Their `lastReadMid` is updated to the last visible message
   - Update happens automatically after 1 second

2. **When displaying messages:**

   - Each message checks which users have `lastReadMid` equal to that message ID
   - Only shows users other than the message sender
   - Names are displayed as "seen by Alice, Bob, Charlie"

3. **Read receipts visibility:**
   - Only appears under messages in group chats
   - Never shown in DM conversations (DMs keep existing checkmark system)
   - Only shows if at least one other user has seen the message

### DM Conversations

- **Unchanged:** DMs continue to use the existing checkmark system (âœ“, âœ“âœ“, read status)
- No "seen by" labels in DMs

---

## ðŸ”„ Real-Time Updates

All read receipts update in real-time via Firestore listeners:

1. User A views a message â†’ their `lastReadMid` updates in Firestore
2. User B's app receives the update via `subscribeToReadReceipts`
3. User B sees "seen by User A" appear under the message instantly
4. No refresh needed - updates are live

---

## ðŸ“± User Experience

### Visual Design

- **Label Position:** Under the message bubble, left-aligned
- **Width:** Maximum 50% of screen width
- **Typography:**
  - "seen by" in italics (secondary color)
  - Names in medium weight (secondary color)
  - Small font size (xs)

### Interaction

- **No Overflow:** Label is static, no interaction
- **With Overflow:**
  - Initial state shows truncated with "..."
  - Tap to expand to full list
  - Tap again to collapse
  - Visual feedback (opacity) when tapping

### Performance

- Efficient filtering per message (only checks read receipts matching message ID)
- Real-time subscriptions are per-conversation (not per-message)
- No unnecessary re-renders

## ðŸ§ª Testing Checklist

### Group Chat Scenarios

- [ ] Create a group chat with 3+ users
- [ ] User A sends a message
- [ ] User B opens the chat â†’ "seen by User B" appears for User A and User C
- [ ] User C opens the chat â†’ "seen by User B, User C" appears for User A
- [ ] Test with long names that overflow â†’ verify expand/collapse works
- [ ] Send multiple messages â†’ verify each shows correct read status
- [ ] Test with users who haven't read yet â†’ verify no label appears

### DM Scenarios

- [ ] Open a DM conversation
- [ ] Send a message
- [ ] Verify checkmarks still work (âœ“ sent, âœ“âœ“ delivered, blue âœ“âœ“ read)
- [ ] Verify no "seen by" label appears in DMs

### Edge Cases

- [ ] User leaves group â†’ verify their read receipts remain
- [ ] User joins group after messages sent â†’ verify no read receipts for old messages
- [ ] Very long user names â†’ verify truncation works
- [ ] Multiple users with same display name â†’ verify all show up

### Performance

- [ ] Scroll through long message list â†’ verify smooth scrolling
- [ ] Multiple users reading simultaneously â†’ verify no lag
- [ ] Switch between conversations â†’ verify subscriptions clean up properly

## ðŸ“Š Data Structure Example

```typescript
// Firestore Structure
conversations/
  {conversationId}/
    type: "group"
    members: ["userA", "userB", "userC"]
    ...

    messages/
      {messageId1}: { text: "Hello", senderId: "userA", ... }
      {messageId2}: { text: "Hi there", senderId: "userB", ... }
      {messageId3}: { text: "Hey", senderId: "userC", ... }

    participants/
      userA: { userId: "userA", lastReadMid: "messageId3", updatedAt: Timestamp }
      userB: { userId: "userB", lastReadMid: "messageId2", updatedAt: Timestamp }
      userC: { userId: "userC", lastReadMid: "messageId1", updatedAt: Timestamp }
```

**Interpretation:**

- User A has read up to message 3 (latest)
- User B has read up to message 2
- User C has read up to message 1

**Display:**

- Message 1: "seen by User A, User B, User C" (all have read at least this)
- Message 2: "seen by User A, User B" (User C hasn't reached this)
- Message 3: "seen by User A" (only User A has read this)

## ðŸ”„ Comparison to Task Spec

### Original Requirement

> "In group chats, the read receipts will appear differently than DMs. Under the last message there will be a small label saying 'seen by' followed by the users who have seen it separated by commas. If no user has seen it yet, then there will be no label. The label's width should only be in the left half of the screen and if the label starts to go past one line then the user will be able to expand it to see the full list and minimize it."

### Implementation

âœ… **Group chats only:** Read receipts only show in group chats, not DMs  
âœ… **"seen by" label:** Displays exactly as specified  
âœ… **Comma-separated names:** Users are separated by commas  
âœ… **No label when unseen:** If no users have seen it, no label appears  
âœ… **Left half width:** maxWidth set to 50%  
âœ… **Expand/collapse:** Tap to expand when overflow, tap to collapse

**Additional Features Added:**

- Real-time updates via Firestore listeners
- Secure read receipts (users can only update their own)
- Efficient per-message filtering
- Graceful handling of user name lookups
- Automatic update on message viewing
