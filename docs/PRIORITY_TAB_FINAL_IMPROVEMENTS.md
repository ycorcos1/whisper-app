# Priority Tab - Final Improvements

## 🎯 Improvements Implemented

### 1. Fixed Conversation Names ✅

**Problem:**

- All messages showed "Unknown" as conversation name
- No distinction between DM and group chat
- Sender name was shown but conversation context was missing

**Solution:**

- **Group chats:** Show group name (or "Unnamed Conversation" if no name set)
- **DM conversations:** Show the other person's name only
- **Group messages:** Show both conversation name AND who said it
- **DM messages:** Show only the sender's name (no redundancy)

**Example:**

```
Before:
Unknown                                          2d ago
John Smith
Team, we have an urgent issue...

After (Group):
Project Manager                                  2d ago
John Smith
Team, we have an urgent issue...

After (DM):
John Smith                                       2d ago
Team, we have an urgent issue...
```

### 2. Mark as Done System ✅

**Problem:**

- "Close Panel" button didn't provide value
- No way to dismiss handled priority messages
- Once marked as priority, messages stayed forever

**Solution:**

- Replaced "Close Panel" with "Mark as Done" / "Mark as Pending"
- Messages marked as done are:
  - Dimmed (60% opacity)
  - Hidden by default
  - Can be toggled visible with "Show Done" filter
- Done status persists in AsyncStorage
- Green styling for done items

**Features:**

- ✅ Toggle individual messages as done/pending
- ✅ "Show Done" / "Hide Done" filter toggle
- ✅ Visual distinction (dimmed, green button)
- ✅ Empty state shows count of done messages
- ✅ Persists across app restarts

## 💾 Data Persistence

### Storage Key

```typescript
const DONE_MESSAGES_KEY = "casper:priority:done";
```

### Storage Format

```json
[
  "conversationId1-messageId1",
  "conversationId2-messageId2",
  ...
]
```

### AsyncStorage Operations

- **Load:** On component mount
- **Save:** After every toggle
- **Structure:** Set of "cid-messageId" keys

---

## 🔄 State Management

### New State Variables

```typescript
const [showDone, setShowDone] = useState(false);
const [doneMessageIds, setDoneMessageIds] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());
```

### Filtering Logic

```typescript
const filteredMessages = showDone
  ? messages
  : messages.filter((msg) => !msg.isDone);
```

### Toggle Function

```typescript
const toggleDone = async (cid: string, messageId: string) => {
  // Toggle in Set
  // Update messages state
  // Save to AsyncStorage
};
```

---

## 🎯 Empty States

### No Priority Messages (with nothing done)

```
✓ (green check)
No Urgent Messages!
Messages with urgent keywords or patterns will appear here

Detected patterns:
• "URGENT", "ASAP", "CRITICAL"
• Multiple exclamation marks (!!!)
• "by EOD", "by tomorrow"
• ALL CAPS MESSAGES
```

### All Messages Marked as Done

```
✓ (green check)
