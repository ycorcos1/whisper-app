# PR #10 — Group Chats (3+ Users) — Completion Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented group chat functionality for the Whisper MVP, enabling conversations with 3 or more participants. This PR extends the existing direct messaging (DM) infrastructure to support multi-user conversations with proper sender attribution and member management.

## Changes Made

### 1. Conversations API (`src/features/conversations/api.ts`)

#### Added Functions:

- **`createGroupConversation(userIds: string[])`** - Creates a new group conversation with multiple members (minimum 2 other users + current user)
- **`getConversation(conversationId: string)`** - Retrieves conversation details including type and members
- **`getUserDisplayName(userId: string)`** - Helper function to resolve user display names

#### Updated Functions:

- **`subscribeToUserConversations()`** - Enhanced to handle both DM and group conversations:
  - For DMs: Shows the other user's name (existing behavior)
  - For groups: Shows comma-separated list of all member names (except current user)
  - Presence badges only shown for DM conversations (not for groups)

### 2. New Chat Screen (`src/screens/NewChatScreen.tsx`)

#### Enhancements:

- **Multi-user selection**: Users can now select multiple recipients
- **Dynamic button text**:
  - "Create Chat" for 1 user (DM)
  - "Create Group (N)" for 2+ users (group chat)
- **Smart conversation creation**: Automatically determines whether to create DM or group based on selection count
- **Group naming**: Generates group name from selected user display names (comma-separated)

### 3. Chat Screen (`src/screens/ChatScreen.tsx`)

#### New Features:

- **Conversation type detection**: Fetches and stores conversation details to determine if it's a group
- **Sender name enrichment**: For group chats, loads all member names and enriches messages with sender information
- **Context-aware rendering**: Passes `showSender` flag to MessageItem component based on conversation type

#### Implementation Details:

- Added state for `conversation` (ConversationDoc) and `senderNames` (userId → displayName mapping)
- Messages in group chats are enriched with sender names before rendering
- Only shows sender attribution for messages from other users (not own messages)

### 4. Message Item Component (`src/components/MessageItem.tsx`)

#### New Props:

- **`showSender?: boolean`** - Flag to indicate whether to show sender name
- **`message.senderName?: string`** - Optional sender display name for group messages

#### UI Updates:

- Displays sender name above message text in group chats
- Sender name styled in amethyst color with smaller font
- Only shown for messages from other users in group conversations

### 5. Messages API (`src/features/messages/api.ts`)

#### Type Updates:

- **`Message` interface** - Added optional `senderName?: string` field to support sender attribution

## Data Model

### Firestore Conversations Collection

```typescript
conversations/{conversationId}:
  members: string[]           // Array of user IDs (sorted)
  type: "dm" | "group"        // Conversation type
  lastMessage?: {
    text: string
    senderId: string
    timestamp: Timestamp
  }
  updatedAt: Timestamp
```

**Group Chat Example:**

```json
{
  "members": ["user1_uid", "user2_uid", "user3_uid", "user4_uid"],
  "type": "group",
  "updatedAt": "2025-10-21T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## User Experience

### Creating a Group Chat

1. User taps the "+" button on Conversations screen
2. Searches for and selects 2+ users
3. Button changes to show "Create Group (N)" where N is the number of selected users
4. Taps button to create group
5. Navigated to chat screen with group name showing all member names

### Sending Messages in Groups

1. User types and sends message in group chat
2. Message appears instantly with optimistic UI (no sender name for own messages)
3. Other members see the message with sender attribution:
   - Sender's display name appears above message text
   - Styled in amethyst color for clear visibility

### Viewing Group Conversations

1. Conversations list shows group chats with all member names (comma-separated)
2. No presence badge for groups (presence only shown for DMs)
3. Last message preview works the same as DMs

## Technical Implementation Details

### Performance Considerations

- **Lazy loading of names**: User display names are only fetched for group members when conversation is opened
- **Caching**: Sender names cached in component state to avoid repeated lookups
- **Efficient queries**: Conversation listing uses existing Firestore query with type differentiation

### Message Flow

1. **Send**:

   - Same logic as DMs - no special handling needed
   - All group members receive message via Firestore listener

2. **Receive**:

   - Messages enriched with sender names in ChatScreen
   - MessageItem conditionally displays sender based on `showSender` prop

3. **Delivery States**:
   - Existing delivery/read receipt logic works for groups
   - Messages marked as delivered/read per recipient (same as DMs)

## Validation & Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [x] Create group with exactly 2 other users (3 total)
- [x] Create group with 5+ users
- [x] Send messages in group - verify sender names appear for others
- [x] Verify own messages don't show sender name
- [x] Check conversations list shows all member names
- [x] Confirm presence badge not shown for groups
- [x] Test optimistic UI in groups
- [x] Verify delivery states work in groups
- [x] Test typing indicators in groups

### TypeScript Compilation

```bash
✓ npx tsc --noEmit  # Passed successfully
```

**Note**: A stale language server cache may show a false positive error for the `showSender` prop. The TypeScript compiler confirms the code is correct. Restart IDE if needed to clear cache.

## Merge Criteria

✅ **All requirements met:**

- [x] Allow conversation creation with multiple members (2+ other users)
- [x] Show sender attribution per message in groups
- [x] Handle group message delivery logic (works with existing infrastructure)
- [x] Group messaging works for 3+ users
- [x] Conversations list properly displays group chats
- [x] No regressions to DM functionality
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes

## Follow-up Considerations

### Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

1. **Group Management**:

   - Add/remove members
   - Group name editing
   - Group avatar/icon

2. **UI Improvements**:

   - Avatar circles overlapping for groups in conversation list
   - Member count badge
   - Admin/moderator roles

3. **Notifications**:

   - Group-specific notification settings
   - Mention system (@username)

4. **Performance**:
   - Paginate member lists for very large groups
   - Cache user profiles in AsyncStorage

### Known Limitations

- No explicit group name field (uses comma-separated member names)
- No group avatar support
- No member management (can't add/remove after creation)
- All members have equal privileges

## Deployment Notes

### Database Migrations

No migrations required. The `type` field on conversations distinguishes between DM and group chats. Existing DM conversations will continue to work as-is.

### Security Rules

Existing Firestore rules support group chats:

```javascript
// Existing rule - works for both DMs and groups
match /conversations/{conversationId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth.uid in resource.data.members;
}
```

## Summary

PR #10 successfully extends Whisper's messaging infrastructure to support group chats with 3+ users. The implementation:

- ✅ Seamlessly integrates with existing DM functionality
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility
- ✅ Follows established patterns and conventions
- ✅ Provides clear visual differentiation between DMs and groups
- ✅ Ensures proper sender attribution for multi-user conversations

**Ready for merge** pending language server cache refresh (restart IDE if linter shows false positive).
