### ✅ Ready to Use

1. **User Authentication**

   - Email/password signup
   - Email/password login
   - Auth state persistence
   - User session management

2. **Firestore Database**

   - Create/read/update users
   - Create/read conversations
   - Send/receive messages
   - Real-time listeners
   - Offline persistence

3. **Realtime Database**

## 🔜 Next Steps: PR #3 — Authentication

With Firebase fully configured, you're ready to implement authentication:

### Tasks for PR #3

1. Create auth context (`src/state/auth/AuthContext.tsx`)
2. Build functional AuthScreen with login/signup forms
3. Add auth state listener
4. Implement route guarding (Auth → Home flow)
5. Create user profile in Firestore on signup
6. Add loading states and error handling
7. Test signup, login, and logout flows

### Expected Outcome

- Users can sign up with email/password
- Users can log in with email/password
- Auth state persists across app restarts
- Navigation automatically redirects based on auth state
- User profiles are created in Firestore

## 🔒 Security Highlights

### Firestore Security

- **Users collection:** Public read, owner-only write
- **Conversations:** Only members can read/write
- **Messages:** Only conversation members can access
- **No anonymous access:** All operations require authentication

### Realtime Database Security

- **Presence:** Each user controls only their own status
- **Typing:** Each user controls only their own typing state
- **Default deny:** All other paths are locked down

### Best Practices Implemented

- ✅ Production mode enabled (no test mode)
- ✅ Member-based access control
- ✅ User ownership validation
- ✅ No public write access
- ✅ Authenticated read/write only

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Firestore Indexes:** May take 1-2 minutes to finish building. Check status in Console.
2. **Storage Disabled:** Upgrade to Blaze plan to enable image features
3. **Environment Variables:** Keep `.env` file private and never commit it
4. **Rules Updates:** Deploy rules after any security changes: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,database:rules`

---

## 🎯 Status: Ready for Development!

Your Firebase backend is now:

- ✅ Fully configured
- ✅ Secured with production rules
- ✅ Connected to your app
- ✅ Ready for authentication implementation

**You can now proceed to PR #3 (Authentication)!** 🚀
