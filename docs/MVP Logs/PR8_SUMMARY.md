## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Image Upload & Display

1. Open the app and navigate to any chat conversation
2. Tap the camera button (üì∑) in the message composer
3. **Grant permission** when prompted for media library access
4. Select an image from your device
5. **Observe:**
   - Upload progress bar appears with percentage
   - Input is disabled during upload
   - Image message appears after upload completes
   - Image displays in chat with proper styling
   - Message shows delivery status indicators

**Expected Result:** Image uploads successfully and displays in the chat.

### Test 2: Thumbnail Generation

1. Send an image message (follow Test 1)
2. Wait 3-5 seconds for Cloud Function to process
3. **Check Firebase Console:**
   - Go to Storage ‚Üí `message_media/{conversationId}/{messageId}_thumb.jpg`
   - Verify thumbnail was created
4. **Check Firestore:**
   - Navigate to `conversations/{cid}/messages/{mid}`
   - Verify `image.thumbnailUrl` field is populated
5. **In app:** Reload the chat
6. **Observe:** Image should load faster (using thumbnail)

**Expected Result:** Thumbnail is generated and used for display.

### Test 3: Full-Screen Image Viewer

1. In a chat with image messages, tap on any image
2. **Observe:**
   - Full-screen modal opens with black overlay
   - Image displays at full resolution
   - Close button (‚úï) appears in top-right
   - Loading indicator shows while image loads
3. Tap the close button
4. **Observe:** Modal closes, returns to chat

**Expected Result:** Full-screen viewer works smoothly.

### Test 4: Image Upload Error Handling

#### Test 4a: Permission Denied

1. In device settings, **revoke** media library permission for Expo Go
2. Try to send an image
3. **Observe:** Alert appears requesting permission
4. Grant permission and try again

**Expected Result:** Graceful permission handling.

#### Test 4b: Large File

1. Try to upload an image larger than 10MB
2. **Observe:** Alert appears: "Image size exceeds 10MB limit"

**Expected Result:** Size validation works.

#### Test 4c: Invalid Format

1. Try to upload a non-image file (if possible in test environment)
2. **Observe:** Error message about invalid format

**Expected Result:** MIME type validation works.

### Test 5: Message Status Indicators

1. Send an image message
2. **Observe status progression:**
   - Upload progress bar shows during upload
   - ‚è± appears briefly (sending)
   - ‚úì appears (sent)
   - ‚úì‚úì appears (delivered)
   - ‚úì‚úì in blue (read)

**Expected Result:** Status indicators work for image messages.

### Test 6: Group Chat Image Messages

1. Create or open a group chat (3+ members)
2. Send an image message
3. **Observe:**
   - Image displays correctly
   - No sender name shown (since it's your message)
4. Have another user send an image
5. **Observe:**
   - Their image displays
   - Sender name appears above image bubble

**Expected Result:** Group chat image messages work correctly.

### Test 7: Offline Behavior

1. Send an image while online (works normally)
2. Disconnect from internet
3. Try to send another image
4. **Observe:** Upload fails with error message
5. Reconnect to internet
6. **Note:** Currently, offline image queueing is not implemented
   - Images must be sent while online
   - This is acceptable for MVP

**Expected Result:** Clear error when offline.

### Test 8: Multiple Images in Conversation

1. Send multiple images in a conversation
2. Scroll through the message list
3. **Observe:**
   - All images render correctly
   - Thumbnails load efficiently
   - Tap different images to view full-screen
   - Each opens the correct full-res image

**Expected Result:** Multiple images render and function correctly.

## üìä Storage Structure

### Uploaded Images

```
message_media/
  {conversationId}/
    {messageId}/
      original.jpg (or .png, .webp)
```

### Generated Thumbnails

```
message_media/
  {conversationId}/
    {messageId}_thumb.jpg
```

**Note:** Thumbnails are always JPEG regardless of original format for consistency and file size optimization.

---

## üîê Security Rules

Storage rules already configured in `storage.rules`:

```javascript
// Message media (images shared in conversations)
match /message_media/{conversationId}/{messageId}/{fileName} {
  allow read: if isAuthenticated();
  allow create: if isAuthenticated() && isValidImage() && isValidSize(10);
  allow update, delete: if false;
}

// Thumbnails
match /message_media/{conversationId}/{messageId}_thumb.jpg {
  allow read: if isAuthenticated();
  allow write: if false; // Only Cloud Functions can write
}
```

**Security Features:**

- ‚úÖ Only authenticated users can read/upload
- ‚úÖ 10MB size limit enforced
- ‚úÖ MIME type validation
- ‚úÖ Messages are immutable (no updates/deletes)
- ‚úÖ Only Cloud Functions can write thumbnails

---

## üé® Design System Compliance

### Colors

- **Image button:** Matches background color
- **Progress bar:** Uses `amethystGlow` for fill
- **Loading indicators:** Uses theme colors
- **Full-screen overlay:** Black at 95% opacity

### Spacing

- Camera button: 40x40px with proper padding
- Image bubbles: Reduced padding (xs) to showcase images
- Progress bar: Consistent theme spacing

### Typography

- Progress text: `fontSize.sm` with `textSecondary` color
- Error messages: Red (#ff6b6b) with italic style
- Timestamps: Consistent with text messages

### Interactions

- Tap image ‚Üí Full-screen viewer
- Tap close ‚Üí Return to chat
- Disabled states during upload

## üêõ Known Limitations (MVP Scope)

1. **No Offline Queueing for Images**

   - Images must be uploaded while online
   - Text messages support offline queueing (from PR #5)
   - Future enhancement: Queue images locally

2. **No Image Compression Before Upload**

   - Images uploaded at original quality (0.9 quality setting)
   - 10MB limit helps prevent huge files
   - Future enhancement: Client-side compression

3. **No Multi-Image Selection**

   - One image at a time
   - Future enhancement: Multi-select and batch upload

4. **Thumbnail Generation Delay**

   - 3-5 seconds between upload and thumbnail availability
   - Original image shows immediately
   - This is expected behavior for Cloud Functions

5. **No Image Editing**
   - No cropping, filters, or annotations
   - Future enhancement: Basic editing tools

---

## üîç Testing with Firebase Emulators (Optional)

To test locally with emulators:

```bash
# Start emulators
firebase emulators:start

# In app.config.ts, set:
# FIREBASE_USE_EMULATOR=true
```

**Emulator Ports:**

- Storage: `localhost:9199`
- Functions: `localhost:5001`
- Firestore: `localhost:8080`

**Note:** Image uploads work with emulators, but you'll need to manually inspect Storage emulator to verify thumbnails.

---

## üìà Performance Considerations

### Image Loading

- Thumbnails load first (faster, smaller file)
- Fall back to original if thumbnail not available
- Progressive JPEG for better perceived performance

### Upload Optimization

- Progress tracking provides user feedback
- Single-image upload prevents UI blocking
- Disabled input during upload prevents race conditions

### Cloud Function Efficiency

- Only processes images in `message_media/` directory
- Skips already-processed thumbnails
- Automatic cleanup of temp files
- Comprehensive error handling prevents function hanging

---

## üéØ Success Criteria (All Met ‚úÖ)

- ‚úÖ Users can pick images from device media library
- ‚úÖ Images upload to Firebase Storage with progress tracking
- ‚úÖ Image messages display in chat with thumbnails
- ‚úÖ Full-screen viewer works for image viewing
- ‚úÖ Cloud Function generates thumbnails automatically
- ‚úÖ Thumbnails update message documents in Firestore
- ‚úÖ Security rules enforce proper access control
- ‚úÖ Error handling provides clear user feedback
- ‚úÖ Design system compliance maintained
